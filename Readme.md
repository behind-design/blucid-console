# BLucid â€¢ Console
Expanding Lucid console capabilities for Lucid Architecture.

## Command Line Interface
The console ships with a command line interface called `blucid` that you can find in `vendor/bin/blucid` and use as
```
blucid make:model Video
blucid make:policy Post
blucid make:request UpdatePost
```

> To be able to address the `blucid` cli directly you need to have `./vendor/bin` as part of your `$PATH`.
To do that, put this in your shell profile (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/bashrc) `export PATH="$PATH:./vendor/bin`"
